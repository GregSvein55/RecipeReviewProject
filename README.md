# RecipeReviewProject
This was my final project/culmination of assignments, for my WebDev 215 class. It is a recipe reviewing website. You are able to make an account and leave reviews for different recipes.  I used PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. It will be up on the U of R's servers for the next couple years after this was posted at http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~gds412/as1/login.php
