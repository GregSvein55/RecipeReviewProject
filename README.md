# RecipeReviewProject
This was my final project/culmination of assignments, for my WebDev 215 class. It is a recipe reviewing website. You are able to make an account and leave reviews for different recipes.  I used PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. It will be up on the U of R's servers for the next couple years after this was posted at http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~gds412/as1/login.php

If you want to test it out, go to that link and make an account, you can use a fake email and password it doesn't matter. Then login using your credentials and you can check it out as a semi-finished product. For context about the system, I got most of my marks if the system could register a new user and sign them in, not as much on the looks or actual recipes being uploaded, as they are all tests at the moment.
